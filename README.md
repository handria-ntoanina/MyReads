# MyReads Project
This is a web application developed with React. It demonstrates basic React implementation using components, routing, state management, controlled components, PropTypes, local storage, API calls, and inverse data flow.

In terms of features, this allows a user:
* to search for a book using the criteria found under `SEARCH_TERMS.md` and add it to a shelf (currently reading, want to read, read)
* to remove a book from a shelf
* to move a book to a different shelf
